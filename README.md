# SSSoftware's Services

I have a lot of sparetime therefore i provide a bunch of "freelance" services. Such include:
1. Software development 
If you are reading this, then you have already found my github. Go checkout to see what i can develop, so you arent dissapointed if i cant develop the new great ML/AI bot to make you rich or take over the world... (duh)

2. Building services:
For these i offer either you picking the parts on your own, or that i help you pick them.
- PC Building. 
- Custom keyboard building. 

3. Music production
Mixing and mastering. I dont own a studio (as of yet) and you will therefore have to figure that out yourself.
